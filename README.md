> A simplified implementation of TypeScript's type-system written in TypeScript's own type-system

### Introduction

This project includes a (very) simplified implementation of [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)'s type-system that's written in [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)'s own type-system.

The implementation uses types only ‚Äî with no runtime code whatsoever, and to see it in action you'll need to hover your mouse over the resulting type.

You enter TypeScript code as string and get possible type errors back (**[See the live demo]()**):

```typescript
import type { TypeCheck } from 'hypescript';

type Errors = TypeCheck<`

function foo(name: number) {
  return name
}

foo('not a number')

`>;

// Errors is now equal to the following type:
type Expected = ["Line 7: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'."];
```

The implementation includes a tokenizer, parser, and a type-checker and includes comments explaining how everything works.

*‚òù Please note that this project is meant to be used for fun and learning purposes and not for practical use.*

### Try running the code

See a live demo in your browser on the [TypeScript Playground]().

Alternatively, install `hypescript` in your own project with `yarn` or `npm` ([TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) 4.7 or later is required):

```
yarn add hypescript
```

### Supported features and syntax

Some TypeScript syntax and features haven't been implemented and won't work. Here's a list of examples (with demo links) for some of the capabilites:

- [Calling a function with insufficient arguments]()
- [Calling a function with wrong argument types]()
- [Trying to access a variable that haven't been defined]()
- [Accessing a property that doesn't exist on an object]()
- [Trying to assign a value to a variable that doesn't match its type annotation]()
- [Trying to access a variable that haven't been defined]()
