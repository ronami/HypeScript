> A simplified implementation of TypeScript's type-system written in TypeScript's own type-system

### Introduction

This project includes a (very) simplified implementation of TypeScript's type-system that's written in TypeScript's own type-system.

The implementation include a tokenizer and parser, along with the type-system. The code contains comments explaining in detail how everything works.

*‚òù Please note that this project is meant to be used for fun and learning purposes and not for practical use.*

### Try running the code

See it live on your browser on the [TypeScript Playground]().

Alternatively, clone the repository with the following:

```
git clone
```

Install dependencies with `Yarn` or `npm`:

```
yarn install
```

Open any file and hover over the types to see the results of "running" that them with some input (try hovering the resulting type).

You can also run tests (written with [tsd]()) with:

```
yarn test
```

### Supported features and syntax

Some syntax or type checking features aren't supported (yet), here's what currently works:
