> A simplified implementation of TypeScript's type-system written in TypeScript's own type-system

### Introduction

This is a simplified implementation of [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)'s type-system that's written in TypeScript's type annotations. This means that it uses types only ‚Äî with no runtime code whatsoever.

You pass TypeScript code as string to the `TypeCheck` generic and get possible type errors back (**[See the live demo]()**):

```typescript
import type { TypeCheck } from 'hypescript';

type Errors = TypeCheck<`

function foo(name: number) {
  return name;
}

foo('not a number');

`>;

// Errors is now equal to the following type:
type Expected = [
  "7: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'."
];
```

Or you can try a more challenging example:

```typescript
import type { TypeCheck } from 'hypescript';

type Errors = TypeCheck<`

function createObject(someBoolean: boolean) {
  function getValue() {
    if (someBoolean) {
      return someBoolean;
    }

    return 0;
  }

  const object = {
    key: getValue
  };

  return object;
}

const result: number = createObject(true).key();

`>;

// Errors is now equal to the following type:
type Expected = [
  "19: Type 'boolean | number' is not assignable to type 'number'."
];
```

*‚òù Please note that this project is meant to be used for fun and learning purposes and not for practical use.*

### Try running the code

See a live demo in your browser on the [TypeScript Playground]().

Alternatively, install `hypescript` in your own project with `yarn` or `npm` (TypeScript 4.7 or later is required):

```
yarn add hypescript
```

### Example showcase

Some TypeScript syntax and features haven't been implemented and won't work. Here's a list of examples (with browser demo links) for some capabilites:

- [Declaring and assigning variables with primitive values]()
- [Defining and calling functions]()
- [Instantiating arrays and accessing their members]()
- [Creating objects and accessing their properties]()
- [Inferring complex return value of functions]()
