> A simplified implementation of TypeScript's type-system written in TypeScript's own type-system

### Introduction

This project includes a simplified implementation of TypeScript's type-system that's written in TypeScript's own type-system.

*‚òù Please note that this project is meant to be used for fun and learning purposes and not for practical use.*

### Supported features and syntax

Some syntax or type checking features aren't supported (yet), here's what currently works:
